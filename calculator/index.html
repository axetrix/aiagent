    The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished is a large oil painting by William Etty, first exhibited in 1825. It depicts a scene of a defeated soldier, a victorious soldier, and a woman pleading for mercy. The painting is not based on a specific historical or literary event but is from the artist's imagination. It attracted praise for its technical excellence and fusion of different painting styles. Etty described the painting's purpose as showing "the beauty of mercy."

    The painting was influenced by classical artworks like the Elgin Marbles and the works of Antonio Canova. Critics at the time noted its combination of Venetian and English painting styles.

    Despite initial praise, the painting failed to sell immediately but was later bought by John Martin and eventually found its way to the National Gallery of Scotland.
